I'm Emily, a former software engineer who's moved into the realm of Film & TV production and now works as a Digital Imaging Technician on various sets. While I love my current role, I still love to write code, exclusively as a hobby. Here you will find some of the various projects that I've started either out of curiosity or to help me with my workflow as a DIT.
